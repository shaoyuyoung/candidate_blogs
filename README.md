## 🛠️AI Infra
#### How to debug a PyTorch model?

#### How should we submit a bug report for PyTorch?

#### How should we fix bugs based on bug reports for PyTorch?

## 🛡️Fuzz Testing

#### How to design a simple and effective fuzzing tool?


## 🤖Large Language Models

#### Some issues we may encounter when using vLLM or SGLang for LLM local deployments
outline@shaoyu: The goal of this section is to address some issues when we install and use LLM inference enginees. These engines are in highly rapid development and not stable, resulting in some easy instructions being needed.

#### Some considerations for invoking API services
outlint@shaoyu: Well, invoking API services is usually costly. A few practical tips can prevent us from wasting unnecessary 🤑**money** in the initial debugging and large-scale experiments.

## 🤔What happens when they get together?
> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> Actually, my research focuses on the intersection of the above three areas. So it is necessary to introduce **how we can use *LLM*-based *fuzzing* techniques to test *AI Infras***.

#### Prompt design
#### Test (Code) generation
#### Test Execution for Infra
#### Result Analysis
#### Feedback guidance
