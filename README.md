## 🛠️AI Infra
#### How to debug a PyTorch model?

#### How should we submit a bug report for PyTorch?

#### How should we fix bugs based on bug reports for PyTorch?

## 🛡️Fuzz Testing

#### How to design a simple and effective fuzzing tool?


## 🤖Large Language Models

#### Some issues we may encounter when using vLLM or SGLang for LLM local deployments
@shaoyu: stay tunned



## 🤔What happens when they get together?
> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> Actually, my research focuses on the intersection of the above three areas. So it is necessary to introduce **how we can use *LLM*-based *fuzzing* techniques to test *AI Infras***.

#### Prompt design
#### Test (Code) generation
#### Test Execution for Infra
#### Result Analysis
#### Feedback guidance
